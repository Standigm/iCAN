One hundred twenty-eight blood samples were drawn from members of a single family with atypical vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD-1) characterized by variable expressivity in affected members of at least 5 generations. Because of the late onset of detectable retinal lesions in most family members, phenotype data from only 93 individuals who were at least 14 years of age were analyzed for linkage. Phenotype data from the remaining 35 members of the family who were under age 14 were excluded from the analysis. Maximum-likelihood analysis for linkage between VMD-1 and 13 biochemical and serological markers in the family demonstrated linkage between VMD-1 and the soluble glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT1) locus, which has been tentatively assigned to the short arm of chromosome 16. A maximum lod score of Z = 4.34 (odds favoring linkage of approximately 22,000 to 1) was obtained at a recombination fraction of theta = .05.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 49}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 394}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 666, "end": 673}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 682, "end": 687}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 765}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 779}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 829, "end": 833}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 967}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 104}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 827}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 56}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 110}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 206, "end": 244}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 251}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 266}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 278}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 291}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T9"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
