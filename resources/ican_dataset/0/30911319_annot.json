Aims: Using both data mining and network pharmacology methods, this paper aims to construct a molecule-target-disease network for medicines used for treating mastitis, mine out targets, and signaling pathways related to mastitis and explore the mechanism of Chinese materia medica (CMM) prescriptions in treating mastitis. Methods: A total of 131 CMM prescriptions for treating mastitis were collected from clinical practice and related literatures. A database of prescriptions for treating mastitis (DPTM) was then constructed. Based on data mining method, Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Support System (TCMISS) was employed to mine out high-frequency CMM and key CMM combinations in DPTM. Subsequently, TCM Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Information Database (TCM-ID) were searched for the targets of ingredients of high-frequency CMM. Then, Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanism of TCM (BATMAN-TCM) was searched for diseases and signaling pathways corresponding to the targets of key CMM combinations. The obtained results were denoted as results 1. In addition, human disease database MalaCards was searched for targets and signaling pathways related to mastitis. The obtained results were denoted as results 2. Results 1 and 2 were compared to obtain targets and signaling pathways included in both results, namely, mastitis-related targets of TCMs and mastitis-related signaling pathways that CMM involves in. Then, the biological functions of these targets and signaling pathways were investigated, on which basis the mechanism of CMM prescriptions in treating mastitis was explored. Results: A total of 12 key TCM combinations were identified. Taraxaci Herba, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Paeoniae Radix Alba, semen citri reticulatae, etc. were CMM with the highest frequency of use for treating mastitis. The potential targets of these high-frequency CMM in treating mastitis were intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and lactotransferrin. The potential signaling pathways that key CMM combinations may involve in during mastitis treatment were NF-kappaB signaling pathway, immune system, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Conclusions: From a perspective of network pharmacology, molecule-target-disease analysis may serve as an entry point for the research of mechanism of CMM. On this basis, we studied the mechanism of CMM prescriptions in treating mastitis by data mining and comparison of results. Our work thus provides a new idea and method for studying the working mechanism of CMM prescriptions.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 59}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 1181, "end": 1188}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1356, "end": 1363}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1367, "end": 1375}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1477, "end": 1495}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1530, "end": 1546}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1612, "end": 1620}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1777, "end": 1785}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 2015, "end": 2023}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 288}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 2039, "end": 2046}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 2087, "end": 2095}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 2101, "end": 2134}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 2136, "end": 2142}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 2145, "end": 2158}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 2160, "end": 2164}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 2167, "end": 2201}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 2203, "end": 2206}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 2213, "end": 2229}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 338}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 2245, "end": 2263}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 2294, "end": 2301}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 2312, "end": 2320}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 2336, "end": 2363}, "obj": "PATHWAY"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 2365, "end": 2378}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 2664, "end": 2672}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 350}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 443}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 500, "end": 508}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 613, "end": 621}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 993}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1160, "end": 1173}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 1567, "end": 1575}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 2078, "end": 2086}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 2380, "end": 2406}, "obj": "PATHWAY"}, {"id": "T42", "span": {"begin": 2412, "end": 2433}, "obj": "PATHWAY"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T32"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T40"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T40"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T40"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T26", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T29", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T30", "obj": "T32"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T34", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T41", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R20", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T42", "obj": "T30"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "MPA", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "PATHWAY"}, {"id": "CPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
