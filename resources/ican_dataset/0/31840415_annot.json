Tendinopathy is a great obstacle in clinical practice due to its poor regenerative capacity. The influence of different stages of tendinopathy on effects of leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma (Lr-PRP) has not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the optimal time point for delivery of Lr-PRP on tendinopathy. A tendinopathy model was established by local collagenase injection on the rabbit Achilles tendon. Then after collagenase induction, following treatments were applied randomly on the lesion: (1) 200 mul of Lr-PRP at one week (PRP-1 group), (2) 200 mul of saline at one week (Saline-1 group), (3) 200 mul of Lr-PRP at four week (PRP-2 group), (4) 200 mul of saline at four week (Saline-2 group). Six weeks after collagenase induction, outcomes were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, cytokine quantification, gene expression, histology and transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrated that PRP-1 group had the least cross sectional area and lesion percent of the involved tendon, as well as the lowest signal intensity in MRI among all groups. However, the PRP-2 group showed larger CSA than saline groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that PRP-1group had a higher level of IL-10 but lower level of IL-6 when compared with PRP-2 and saline groups. Meanwhile, the highest expression of Col 1 in PRP-1 and Col 3, MMP-1, MMP-3 in PRP-2 was found. Histologically, the PRP-1 showed better general scores than PRP-2, and no significant difference was found between the PRP-2 and saline groups. For TEM, PRP-1 had the largest mean collagen fibril diameter, and the PRP-2 group showed even smaller mean collagen fibril diameter than saline groups. In conclusion, intra-tendon delivery of Lr-PRP at early stage showed beneficial effect for repair of tendinopathy, but not at late stage. For translation of our results to clinical circumstances, further studies are still needed.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1098, "end": 1103}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1104, "end": 1124}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1143}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1189}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1190, "end": 1206}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 152}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1264, "end": 1270}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1274}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1361, "end": 1367}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1373}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1377, "end": 1382}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1387, "end": 1392}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1398}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1402, "end": 1406}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1466, "end": 1473}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 209}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1474, "end": 1484}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1519}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1521, "end": 1526}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 231}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 1714, "end": 1721}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T42", "span": {"begin": 1727, "end": 1751}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T43", "span": {"begin": 1785, "end": 1792}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T44", "span": {"begin": 1798, "end": 1822}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T46", "span": {"begin": 1912, "end": 1922}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T47", "span": {"begin": 1923, "end": 1929}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T48", "span": {"begin": 1934, "end": 1940}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T49", "span": {"begin": 1944, "end": 1956}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T50", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 132}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T51", "span": {"begin": 1488, "end": 1493}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T52", "span": {"begin": 1507, "end": 1512}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 282}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 456, "end": 468}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 472, "end": 484}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T53", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 98}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T18"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T23"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R18", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T26"}, {"id": "R20", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T27"}, {"id": "R21", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T30", "obj": "T29"}, {"id": "R29", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T34", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R31", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T35", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R35", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T42", "obj": "T41"}, {"id": "R36", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T44", "obj": "T43"}, {"id": "R38", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T48", "obj": "T47"}, {"id": "R39", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T49", "obj": "T46"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R41", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T49", "obj": "T48"}, {"id": "R44", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T51", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R46", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T52", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T3"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "CPA", "default": true}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "REG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
