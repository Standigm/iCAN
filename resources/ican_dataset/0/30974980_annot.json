OBJECTIVE: We purpose to confirm the effect of teneligliptin (Tenelia), a selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, on glycemic control and non-glucose risk factors for macroangiopathy, including blood pressure, lipid metabolism, and body weight. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, open-label, observational study, teneligliptin (20 mg/day) was administered to type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c &gt;= 6.5% to &lt;10%) at our hospitals. The safety of teneligliptin and its impact on blood glucose, blood pressure, and the lipid profile were assessed after administration for 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-two patients were enrolled between February 2014 and August 2015. HbA1c was 7.6% at baseline and showed significant reduction to 7.1% after 3 months of treatment and to 6.9% after 6 months (both p &lt; 0.01). Patients with poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;=130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt;=80 mmHg) at study initiation were extracted to investigate the effect of teneligliptin on blood pressure. SBP showed a significant decrease from 141.2 +- 9.8 mmHg at baseline to 131.1 +- 14.3 mmHg after 3 months and 133.9 +- 11.5 mmHg after 6 months (both p &lt; 0.001). DBP also decreased significantly from 85.8 +- 5.7 mmHg at baseline to 78.4 +- 10.0 mmHg after 3 months and 79.7 +- 10.1 mmHg after 6 months (both p &lt; 0.001). Adverse events were pruritus in four patients, and cerebral infarction was reported as a cerebrovascular event in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Teneligliptin therapy was safe and improved glycemic control irrespective of baseline HbA1c. Blood pressure was also improved in patients with concomitant hypertension.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 96}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 158}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 169, "end": 186}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 205}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 386}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 518}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 500}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-7", "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 393}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 425}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 459, "end": 474}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 323}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 841, "end": 854}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 798}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 815}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 831}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-15", "span": {"begin": 1007, "end": 1012}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-16", "span": {"begin": 1038, "end": 1044}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-17", "span": {"begin": 1057, "end": 1066}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-18", "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1276}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-19", "span": {"begin": 1247, "end": 1271}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-20", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1194}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-21", "span": {"begin": 1221, "end": 1224}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-22", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1219}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-23", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1399}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-24", "span": {"begin": 1414, "end": 1422}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-25", "span": {"begin": 1389, "end": 1392}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-26", "span": {"begin": 1554, "end": 1557}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-27", "span": {"begin": 1563, "end": 1572}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-28", "span": {"begin": 1899, "end": 1915}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-29", "span": {"begin": 1890, "end": 1898}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-30", "span": {"begin": 1941, "end": 1946}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-31", "span": {"begin": 2010, "end": 2022}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-32", "span": {"begin": 1972, "end": 1980}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-33", "span": {"begin": 1948, "end": 1962}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-5", "obj": "T-10"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-6", "obj": "T-10"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-8", "obj": "T-10"}, {"id": "R-3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-11", "obj": "T-12"}, {"id": "R-4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-13", "obj": "T-12"}, {"id": "R-5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-14", "obj": "T-12"}, {"id": "R-6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-15", "obj": "T-16"}, {"id": "R-7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-17", "obj": "T-16"}, {"id": "R-8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-18"}, {"id": "R-9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-19"}, {"id": "R-10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-22"}, {"id": "R-11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-21"}, {"id": "R-12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-25", "obj": "T-23"}, {"id": "R-13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-24", "obj": "T-23"}, {"id": "R-14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-26", "obj": "T-27"}, {"id": "R-15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-28", "obj": "T-29"}, {"id": "R-16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-31", "obj": "T-32"}, {"id": "R-17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-33", "obj": "T-32"}]}
