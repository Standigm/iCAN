Ivermectin is a safe and effective drug for onchocerciasis treatment. In certain individuals, however, therapy is accompanied by adverse reactions. The mechanisms underlying these reactions are not yet known. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neutrophils are involved in the development of these adverse reactions. Elastase and lactoferrin, two markers for the release of neutrophil azurophilic and specific granule contents respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassays in plasma of onchocerciasis patients with varying degrees of side effects, as well as in control subjects before and 1 and 2 days after ivermectin treatment. A considerable increase of elastase levels after treatment was observed, whereas lactoferrin levels did not change. The percentage of patients with elevated elastase levels was significantly correlated with the degree of side effects. These findings suggest that neutrophil activation may be involved in the development of adverse reactions in these patients.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 58}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 815}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 831, "end": 837}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 871, "end": 879}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 914, "end": 924}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1015, "end": 1023}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1031, "end": 1042}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 127}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 194}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 414}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 430}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 578, "end": 592}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 746}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 21}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 758}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 765}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 816, "end": 822}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 888}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 889, "end": 895}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 986, "end": 1007}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T23"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T13"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "CPA", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd", "default": true}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "color": "#555555", "default": true}]}}
