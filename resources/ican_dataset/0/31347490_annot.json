AIMS: Due to their rarity, the natural history and imaging of myxoid meningiomas are not completely characterized. We analyzed clinical, imaging, and pathologic features of myxoid meningioma seen neurosurgically or in consultation between 1999 and 2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archival material was searched for meningiomas designated \"myxoid meningioma\" at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (1997 - 2004) and the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry (1994 - 2018). RESULTS: Our cases were predominantly in females and presented with a slow progression of symptoms. Each tumor was in the hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found most were hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Each meningioma had foci of limited meningothelial amongst extensive myxoid histology with Alcian-blue-staining stroma and EMA-immunoreactive cells. CONCLUSION: Myxoid meningiomas present with atypical imaging and histologic characteristics but are not truly metaplastic, i.e., are not differentiated to a different cell type.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 60}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 142}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 252}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 385}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 398, "end": 415}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 641}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 629}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-7", "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 617}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 665}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 751}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 790}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 844, "end": 860}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 898, "end": 916}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 955, "end": 962}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 954}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-15", "span": {"begin": 1034, "end": 1045}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-5", "obj": "T-7"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-5", "obj": "T-6"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-14", "obj": "T-13"}]}
