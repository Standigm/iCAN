PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevalence of pediatric urolithiasis is increasing, which is definitively visible in increasing numbers of presentations in emergency or outpatient clinics. In pediatric patients, a genetic or metabolic disease has to be excluded, so that adequate treatment can be installed as early as possible. Only then either recurrent stone events and chronic or even end-stage kidney disease can be prevented. RECENT FINDINGS: The genetic background of mostly monogenic kidney stone diseases was unravelled recently. In hypercalcuria, for example, the commonly used definition of idiopathic hypercalciuria was adopted to the genetic background, here three autosomal recessive hereditary forms of CYP24A1, SLC34A1 and SLC34A3 associated nephrocalcinosis/urolithiasis with elevated 1.25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1.25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) (calcitriol) levels. In addition either activating or inactivating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor gene lead either to hypocalcemic hypercalciuria or hypercalcemic hypocalciuria. In primary hyperoxaluria, a third gene defect was unravelled explaining most of the so far unclassified patients. In addition, these findings lead to new treatment options, which are currently evaluated in phase III studies. SUMMARY: Kidney stones are not the disease itself, but only its first symptom. The underlying disease has to be diagnosed in every pediatric patient with the first stone event.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 30}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 34, "end": 49}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 831, "end": 839}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 961, "end": 970}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1008, "end": 1012}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1023, "end": 1050}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1081}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1086, "end": 1107}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 106}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1122, "end": 1128}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1317, "end": 1330}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 542}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 665}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 716, "end": 735}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 840, "end": 913}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 978, "end": 1002}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 763}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 765, "end": 772}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 777, "end": 784}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 795}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 812}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 813, "end": 825}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R18", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R20", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T26", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R22", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R23", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R24", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R25", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R26", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T29", "obj": "T8"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "MPA", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "CauseOf"}, {"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
