PURPOSE: To report the peripheral abnormalities seen only with indocyanine green angiography in patients with vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease, caused by a mutation in the bestrophin gene). DESIGN: Observational case report series. METHODS: Eight eyes of four patients, two with only a central macular lesion and two with multifocal lesions, were studied. Results of indocyanine green angiography were compared with findings from ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Throughout the fundus periphery, indocyanine green angiography demonstrated a number of hyperfluorescent spots in all eight eyes. The spots were observed in the midperiphery and the periphery in areas with no abnormality visible by ophthalmoscopy or fluorescein angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Although Best disease generally causes lesions visible in the posterior pole, the extensive distribution of the hyperfluorescent spots is consistent with the wide-ranging abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch membrane, and the choroid as seen histopathologically.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 62, "end": 91}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 232}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 884, "end": 896}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 907, "end": 913}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 987, "end": 1009}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 246}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 268}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 286}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 662}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 697}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 740}, "obj": "REG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T5"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T1"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
