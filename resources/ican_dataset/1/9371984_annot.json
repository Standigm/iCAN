The past year has seen further advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of the most abundant erythrocyte proteins associated with blood group antigens (band 3, the glycophorins, and the Rh antigen-related proteins). There have also been several important developments in the structural and functional identification of some of the less abundant antigens. These developments include the association of the Colton antigens with the erythrocyte water channel, aquaporin; the cloning of the Duffy antigen and its identification as a chemokine receptor; the cloning of the Kx antigen, which is associated with McLeod syndrome; and the cloning of the LW, CD47, and Xga antigens.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 720}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 726}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 744}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 249}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 530, "end": 539}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 269}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 478, "end": 493}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 573}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 620}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 651}, "obj": "Protein"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 662, "end": 672}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 693}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T8"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "Protein"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
