Its role in other neuroinfections is increasingly recognized but less clear.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of CXCL13 in established central nervous system (CNS) infections other than LNB by matching cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CXCL13 elevations with severity of the disease course.\nMETHODS: We investigated 26 patients with bacterial (n\u2009=\u200910) and viral (n\u2009=\u200916; tick-borne encephalitis, n\u2009=\u20096; varicella zoster infection, n\u2009=\u200910) neuroinfections of whom CSF CXCL13 levels were available twice, from lumbar punctures (LP) performed at admission and follow-up. As outcome classification, we dichotomized disease courses into \"uncomplicated\" (meningitis, monoradiculitis) and \"complicated\" (signs of CNS parenchymal involvement such as encephalitis, myelitis, abscesses, or vasculitis). CXCL13 elevations above 250\u2009pg/ml were classified as highly elevated.\nRESULTS: Eight of 26 patients (31%) with both bacterial (n\u2009=\u20094) and viral (n\u2009=\u20094) neuroinfections had a complicated disease course. All of them but only 3/18 patients (17%) with an uncomplicated disease course had CSF CXCL13 elevations >\u2009250\u2009pg/ml at the follow-up LP (p\u2009<\u20090.001). At admission, 4/8 patients (50%) with a complicated disease course and 3/18 patients (17%) with an uncomplicated disease course showed CXCL13 elevations >\u2009250\u2009pg/ml. All four patients with a complicated disease course but only one with an uncomplicated disease course had sustained CXCL13 elevations at follow-up. Patient groups did not differ with regard to age, time since symptom onset, LP intervals, type of infections, and anti-pathogen treatments.\nCONCLUSION: Our study revealed pronounced CXCL13 elevations in CSF of patients with severe disease courses of bacterial and viral neuroinfections. This observation indicates a role of CXCL13 in the CNS immune defense and points at an additional diagnostic value as biomarker for unresolved immune processes leading to or associated with complications.", "project": "sonoma", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 127}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 172, "end": 193}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 943, "end": 955}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 957, "end": 965}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 991}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 994, "end": 1000}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 1001, "end": 1011}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-15", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1062}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-16", "span": {"begin": 1282, "end": 1288}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-17", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1299}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-18", "span": {"begin": 1480, "end": 1486}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-19", "span": {"begin": 1487, "end": 1497}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 195, "end": 198}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-20", "span": {"begin": 1627, "end": 1633}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-21", "span": {"begin": 1634, "end": 1644}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-22", "span": {"begin": 1841, "end": 1847}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-23", "span": {"begin": 1848, "end": 1858}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-24", "span": {"begin": 1983, "end": 1989}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-25", "span": {"begin": 2106, "end": 2113}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-26", "span": {"begin": 2120, "end": 2130}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-27", "span": {"begin": 2136, "end": 2149}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 322, "end": 328}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 395, "end": 398}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 437, "end": 443}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 454}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-7", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 595}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 604, "end": 630}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 860}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 168}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-18", "obj": "T-19"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-21"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-22", "obj": "T-23"}, {"id": "R-3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-27", "obj": "T-25"}, {"id": "R-4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-27", "obj": "T-26"}, {"id": "R-5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-5", "obj": "T-6"}, {"id": "R-6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-13", "obj": "T-14"}, {"id": "R-7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-16", "obj": "T-17"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-0", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-1", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-2", "obj": "T1"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
