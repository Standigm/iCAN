A 37-kDa protein was immunopurified from human erythrocytes as a complex with a monoclonal antibody directed against the Kell blood group protein of 93 kDa. A rabbit antibody raised against the purified complex reacted on a Western blot with the 93-kDa and 37-kDa proteins and was able to immunoprecipitate the 37-kDa component from K0 erythrocytes which express large amount of the Kx antigen, but not from erythrocytes of patients suffering from McLeod syndrome, a X-linked disorder in which the Kx antigen is lacking. Additional studies have shown that the 37-kDa protein is not glycosylated, and permitted the sequence of the 22 first N-terminal amino acids to be established. This sequence was identical to the predicted protein product of the XK gene cloned recently, which is deleted or mutated in McLeod patients [Ho, M., Chelly, J., Carter, N., Danek, A., Crocker, P. &amp; Monaco, A. P. (1994) Cell 77, 869-880]. Our findings provide strong evidence that the 37-kDa red cell membrane protein is identical to the Kx protein produced by the XK structural gene and demonstrate that Kx and Kell proteins are two subunits expressed as a complex hold by disulfide bond(s) at the red cell surface.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 81}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 896, "end": 903}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 907, "end": 913}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1107, "end": 1116}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1124, "end": 1126}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1153}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1191, "end": 1193}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1202}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 63}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 247}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 91}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1078, "end": 1103}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1135, "end": 1143}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 487}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 565}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 600, "end": 602}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 621}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 853}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 885, "end": 892}, "obj": "VAR"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R18", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T0"}, {"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T0"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "PROTEIN", "default": true}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
