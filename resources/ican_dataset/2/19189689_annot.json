AIM: To verify possible associations among glucocorticoid doses, use of dexamethasone, and bone mineral density (BMD), measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT), in female children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to CYP21 deficiency (CAH-CYP21). Classical CAH-CYP21 in females allows the study of the effects of hyperandrogenism and chronic glucocorticoid exposure. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PATIENTS: Sixteen girls (4-19 years) with CAH-CYP21 and 32 age-matched control girls. MEASUREMENTS: BMD was the main outcome measure assessed by total body and lumbar spine L1-L4 DXA (DXAtot and DXAIs), lumbar spine L1-L4 bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) and spinal L1-L4 QCT of trabecular (QCTtrab) and cortical (QCTcort) bone. The glucocorticoid dose used by patients with CAH-CYP21 was expressed as hydrocortisone equivalents/m2. RESULTS: Mean BMD in both groups was similar by any method. In patients, BMD decreased with the increasing mean dose of glucocorticoid, seen in QCTcort (r = -0.55; p = 0.03) and QCTtrab (r = -0.52; p = 0.04). There was also a negative correlation between cumulative glucocorticoid dose and BMD in QCTcort (beta = -0.0016; p = 0.005) and QCTtrab (beta = -0.0009; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The dose of glucocorticoid used in the treatment of girls with CAH-CYP21 correlated negatively with BMD, and dexamethasone was not selectively harmful.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 88}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 462}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1079, "end": 1088}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1228, "end": 1236}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1237, "end": 1248}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 89, "end": 99}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1472, "end": 1482}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1531, "end": 1538}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 137}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 212}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 362}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 375}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 376, "end": 386}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 75}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 20}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 217}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1016, "end": 1019}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1488, "end": 1491}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1292, "end": 1295}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 787, "end": 816}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 822}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 668}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1078}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T18"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T5"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "CPA", "default": true}, {"id": "DISEASE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
