In onchocerciasis, variations of the host's immune responsiveness produce a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from the common generalized to the rare hyperreactive form (sowda). For further characterization of the immune response, the localization and frequency of mast cells in onchocercomas from untreated and ivermectin-treated patients with hyperreactive onchocerciasis from Liberia and the Yemen were analysed and compared to the generalized form by immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for human mast cell tryptase and chymase, histamine and IgE. The nodules were selected with special regard to only one pair of live, microfilariae-producing Onchocerca volvulus. Throughout the nodular tissue of the hyperreactive form, mast cells accumulated in the strong inflammatory infiltrates, especially near eosinophils and around cellular attacks on microfilariae as well as perivascularly. Their number was significantly higher in the whole nodular tissue compared to the generalized form. The highest numbers occurred in the nodule centre. Mast cells carried IgE and appeared activated. No mast cells were observed in the cystic parts or attached to adult worms or microfilariae. In onchocercomas, 1 and 3 days after treatment with ivermectin, microgranuloma formation by eosinophils and macrophages around damaged microfilariae was enhanced and accompanied by numerous mast cells. Attacks of neutrophils were also pronounced, but attacks by mast cells were not observed. In conclusion, hyperreactivity against microfilariae in onchocercomas clearly correlates with a strong mastocytosis and IgE production parallel to tissue eosinophilia.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 4}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 27}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 636}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 638, "end": 647}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 831, "end": 835}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 842, "end": 853}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1025, "end": 1031}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1098, "end": 1105}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1156, "end": 1163}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1164, "end": 1167}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1181, "end": 1190}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1219}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 75}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1288, "end": 1301}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1364, "end": 1373}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1438, "end": 1446}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1451, "end": 1462}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1466, "end": 1474}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1475, "end": 1479}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1520, "end": 1530}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1592, "end": 1629}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1633, "end": 1646}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1655, "end": 1665}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 102}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1673, "end": 1679}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 1680, "end": 1692}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1697, "end": 1711}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 114}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 158}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 169}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 270}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 387}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 468}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T31", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T32", "obj": "T30"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "VAR"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
