Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome (MVA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by random chromosome gains and losses. Mutations in BUB1B and CEP57 genes have been involved in MVA. Here we report on a male child with MVA due to c.915_925dupCAATGTTCAGC mutation in the CEP57 gene. Our patient was homozygous for this mutation and he is the first case with rhizomelic shortening of both the upper and lower limbs and mild respiratory insufficiency due to a narrow thorax. It is also the second MVA Mexican family reported with this mutation that lives in the northwestern region of Mexico, suggesting a \"local founding effect\". Additional cases are needed to better understand the MVA genotype-phenotype relationship.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 18}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 51}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 107}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 381}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 222}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 374}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 330}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-7", "span": {"begin": 334, "end": 339}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 349}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 227}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 319}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 647}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 422}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 462}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 475}, "obj": "GENE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-0", "obj": "T-1"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-3", "obj": "T-5"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-4", "obj": "T-5"}, {"id": "R-3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-6", "obj": "T-5"}, {"id": "R-4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-7", "obj": "T-6"}, {"id": "R-5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-8", "obj": "T-6"}, {"id": "R-6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-13", "obj": "T-12"}, {"id": "R-7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-14", "obj": "T-13"}]}
