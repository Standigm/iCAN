Trans-(1R*,2R*,3R*)-Ethyl 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-methylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate (6) and its cis isomer 7 were obtained from the reaction of the methyl isoeugenol (5) with ethyl diazoacetate. The reduction and bromination reactions of the ester 6 and 7 together with the hydrolysis of all esters were carried out. Opening ring of cyclopropane was observed in the reaction of 7 with bromine. The opening of cyclopropane ring with COOR and synthesis of esters, alcohols and acids (6-26) are new. These obtained bromophenol derivatives (6-26) were effective inhibitors of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase I and II isoforms (hCA I and II) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes with Ki values in the range of 7.8 +- 0.9-58.3 +- 10.3 nM for hCA I, 43.1 +- 16.7-150.2 +- 24.1 nM for hCA II, and 159.6 +- 21.9-924.2 +- 104.8 nM for AChE, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the most popular drugs applied in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, senile dementia, and ataxia, among others.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 342}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 451, "end": 458}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 963, "end": 967}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 983, "end": 1003}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1028, "end": 1035}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1087, "end": 1106}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1108, "end": 1127}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 492}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 702}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 776, "end": 796}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 802}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1004, "end": 1014}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 771}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 874, "end": 879}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 921}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 747}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R18", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R20", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R21", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R22", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T3"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd", "default": true}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
