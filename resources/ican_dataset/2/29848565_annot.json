Melioidosis is a fatal infectious disease caused by the environmental bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei It is highly endemic in Asia and northern Australia but neglected in many other tropical countries. Melioidosis patients have a wide range of clinical manifestations, and definitive diagnosis requires bacterial culture, which can be time-consuming. A reliable rapid serological tool is greatly needed for disease surveillance and diagnosis. We previously demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that a hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp1) is a promising target for serodiagnosis of melioidosis. In this study, we developed a rapid immunochromatography test (ICT) using Hcp1 as the target antigen (Hcp1-ICT). We evaluated this test for specific antibody detection using serum samples obtained from 4 groups of human subjects, including the following: (i) 487 culture-confirmed melioidosis patients from four hospitals in northeast Thailand; (ii) 202 healthy donors from northeast Thailand; (iii) 90 U.S. healthy donors; and (iv) 207 patients infected with other organisms. Compared to culture results as a gold standard, the sensitivity of ICT for all hospitals was 88.3%. The specificities for Thai donors and U.S. donors were 86.1% and 100%, respectively, and the specificity for other infections was 91.8%. The results of the Hcp1-ICT demonstrated 92.4% agreement with the Hcp1-ELISA results with a kappa value of 0.829, indicating that the method is much improved compared with the current serological method, the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) (69.5% sensitivity and 67.6% specificity for Thais). The Hcp1-ICT represents a potential point-of-care (POC) test and may be used to replace the IHA for screening of melioidosis in hospitals as well as in resource-limited areas.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 47}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 122}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 817, "end": 821}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1035}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1606, "end": 1614}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1869, "end": 1880}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 135}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 172}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 341}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 679}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 681, "end": 685}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 726}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 741}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1476, "end": 1480}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1523, "end": 1527}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T8"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "CPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
