Modulation of host immunity in invasive fungal infection is an appealing but as yet mostly elusive treatment strategy. Animal studies in invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis have demonstrated beneficial effects of colony stimulating factors, interferon-gamma and monoclonal antibodies. More recent studies transfusing leukocytes pre-loaded with lipophilic anti-fungal drugs, or modulated T-cells, along with novel vaccination strategies show great promise. The translation of immune therapies into clinical studies has been limited to date but this is changing and the results of new Candida vaccine trials are eagerly awaited. Immune modulation in HIV-associated mycoses remains complicated by the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and although exogenous interferon-gamma therapy may be beneficial in cryptococcal meningitis, early initiation of anti-retroviral therapy leads to increased mortality. Further study is required to better target protective immune responses.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 10}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 915}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 970, "end": 979}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 980, "end": 989}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 97}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 245}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 274}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 779, "end": 822}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 878, "end": 888}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 68}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 110, "end": 126}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 227}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 312}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 330}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 743}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 846, "end": 862}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T8"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "REG"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
