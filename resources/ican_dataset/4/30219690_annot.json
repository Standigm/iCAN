BACKGROUND: Large sample GWAS is needed to identify genetic factors associated with depression. This study used genome-wide genotypic and phenotypic data from the COPDGene study to identify genetic risk factors for depression. METHODS: Data were from 9716 COPDGene subjects with &gt;=10 pack-year history. Depression was defined as antidepressant use and/or a HADS depression subscale score &gt;=8. Non-Hispanic White (6576) and African-American (3140) subsets were analyzed. A GWAS pipeline identified SNPs associated with depression in each group. Network analysis software analyzed gene interactions through common biological pathways, genetic interactions, and tissue-specific gene expression. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.4 years (SD 9.0) with 46.5% female subjects. Depression was in 24.7% of the NHW group (1622) and 12.5% of the AA group (391). No SNPs had genome-wide significance. One of the top SNPs, rs12036147 (p = 1.28 x 10-6), is near CHRM3. Another SNP was near MDGA2 (rs17118176, p = 3.52 x 10-6). Top genes formed networks for synaptic transmission with a statistically significant level of more co-expression in brain than other tissues, particularly in the basal ganglia (p = 1.00 x 10-4). LIMITATIONS: Limitations included a depression definition based on antidepressant use and a limited HADS score subgroup, which could increase false negatives in depressed patients not on antidepressants. Antidepressants used for smoking cessation in non-depressed patients could lead to false positives. CONCLUSIONS: Systems biology analysis identified statistically significant pathways whereby multiple genes influence depression. The gene set pathway analysis and COPDGene data can help investigate depression in future studies.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 47}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 181, "end": 191}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 1082, "end": 1092}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1206, "end": 1210}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1211, "end": 1224}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1343, "end": 1353}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1468, "end": 1477}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1718, "end": 1727}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1728, "end": 1738}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 322}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 413}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 605, "end": 615}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 621, "end": 631}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 687, "end": 699}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 879}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1019}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1075, "end": 1080}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1052}, "obj": "GENE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T18"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T10"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
