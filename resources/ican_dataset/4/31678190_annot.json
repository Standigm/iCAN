OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical, laboratory and immune characteristics of ZIKV-associated encephalitis in pediatric patients after the epidemic in Huila, southern Colombia. METHODS: A pediatric neuro-surveillance hospital study was conducted in a referral health center in southern Colombia, from October 2016 to October 2017. Cases of encephalitis were confirmed by nucleic acid amplification tests and serological methods in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma and/or urine. Levels of six cytokines were evaluated by flow cytometry. Patients underwent daily clinical and laboratory follow-ups. RESULTS: Twenty children with probable encephalitis were included for further studies and 16 of them were confirmed. Four cases of S. pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, S. epidermidis, and E. coli. bacterial meningoencephalitis and 12 cases of viral encephalitis were identified, six of them associated with ZIKV infection. Other viral encephalitis were caused by Herpes viruses (n = 3), enterovirus (n = 2) and one DENV-2 infection. ZIKV-associated encephalitis symptoms subsided faster compared to those of patients with encephalitis caused by other agents. CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Compared to healthy controls, children with ZIKV-associated encephalitis presented with modest plasma IL-10 but not IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha. Cytokine expression was differentially regulated as dramatically elevated IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-gamma levels were observed in CSF but not in paired plasma in one of the patients with ZIKV detectable in CSF. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that ZIKV is responsible for pediatric encephalitis in endemic areas and the local presence of virus may induce cephalic but not systemic expression of cytokines.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 77}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 197}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 431, "end": 443}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 728, "end": 740}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 887, "end": 916}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 951}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 981, "end": 991}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-7", "span": {"begin": 1043, "end": 1049}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 1019, "end": 1037}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 1123, "end": 1151}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 1161, "end": 1169}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 1170, "end": 1176}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 1212, "end": 1224}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1231}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 1340, "end": 1368}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-15", "span": {"begin": 1529, "end": 1533}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-16", "span": {"begin": 1555, "end": 1561}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-17", "span": {"begin": 1535, "end": 1540}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-18", "span": {"begin": 1384, "end": 1390}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-19", "span": {"begin": 1369, "end": 1378}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-20", "span": {"begin": 1398, "end": 1403}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-21", "span": {"begin": 1520, "end": 1528}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-22", "span": {"begin": 1545, "end": 1554}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-23", "span": {"begin": 1412, "end": 1416}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-24", "span": {"begin": 1418, "end": 1422}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-25", "span": {"begin": 1424, "end": 1428}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-26", "span": {"begin": 1430, "end": 1439}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-27", "span": {"begin": 1444, "end": 1453}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-28", "span": {"begin": 1494, "end": 1503}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-29", "span": {"begin": 1455, "end": 1474}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-30", "span": {"begin": 1714, "end": 1725}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-31", "span": {"begin": 1740, "end": 1752}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-32", "span": {"begin": 1839, "end": 1849}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-33", "span": {"begin": 1853, "end": 1862}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-34", "span": {"begin": 1806, "end": 1812}, "obj": "REG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-8", "obj": "T-7"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-12", "obj": "T-13"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-29", "obj": "T-28"}, {"id": "R-3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-32", "obj": "T-34"}, {"id": "R-4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-33", "obj": "T-32"}, {"id": "R-5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-33", "obj": "T-34"}]}
