ACT-541468 is a dual orexin receptor antagonist with sleep-promoting effects in humans. Following entry-into-humans, its pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose-proportionality and accumulation, pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability following multiple-ascending oral dose (MAD) administration in the morning, and next-day residual effects after repeated evening administration were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. 31 healthy male and female subjects in 3 dose-groups (10, 25, and 75 mg) received study drug in the morning for 5 days (MAD part), and 20 healthy subjects received 25 mg in the evening for 1 week (evening part). PK, PD (saccadic peak velocity (SPV), adaptive tracking, body sway, Bond and Lader visual analogue scales (VAS), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), VAS Bowdle for assessment of psychedelic effects), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Simple Reaction Time Test (SRTT), safety, and tolerability were assessed. ACT-541468 was absorbed with a median tmax of 1.0-2.0 h across the 3 dose groups. The geometric mean elimination half-life (t1/2) on Day 5 was between 5.6 and 8.5 h, and the exposure (area under the curve (AUC)) showed dose proportionality. No accumulation and no influence of sex on the multiple-dose PK parameters of ACT-541468 was observed. No effects were observed at 10 mg. Administration of 25 and 75 mg during the day showed clear dose-dependent effects on the PD parameters, while next-day effects were absent after evening administration of 25 mg. The drug was safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, multiple-dose PK/PD of ACT-541468 were compatible with a drug designated to treat insomnia.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1486, "end": 1493}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1499, "end": 1507}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1592, "end": 1599}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1607, "end": 1620}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1637, "end": 1644}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1650, "end": 1656}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1788, "end": 1798}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1831, "end": 1839}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 880, "end": 889}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1019}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1383, "end": 1395}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 79}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 188}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T17"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "MPA", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
