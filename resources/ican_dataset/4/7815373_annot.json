IL-4- and IL-6-producing cells in human periodontal disease tissues were investigated using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of IL-4-producing cells within the CD45RO+ subset and the percentage of IL-4+ cells was significantly higher in periodontal lesions than in gingivitis tissues (p &lt; 0.01). The percentage of IL-6-producing memory cells was higher in periodontal lesions compared with gingivitis tissues, although it was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). A reverse tendency in IL-4- and IL-6-positive cells was observed in a few individual cases. No IL-4 mRNA could be detected using the in situ hybridization technique. However, high levels of IL-6 mRNA were present in clinically healthy tissues, with a further increase in both epithelium and connective tissues affected by gingivitis, although only the former was significant (p &lt; 0.025). There was a significant decrease in IL-6 mRNA in both the connective tissue (p &lt; 0.025) and epithelium (p &lt; 0.01) in periodontitis tissues compared with levels in gingivitis tissues. However, the levels of IL-6 mRNA in periodontal tissues were high compared with those of IL-1 mRNA, which was used in this study as a positive control. These results suggest that Th2-type cells may accumulate in periodontal lesions.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 59}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 349}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 881, "end": 889}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 944, "end": 954}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1037, "end": 1045}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1136, "end": 1149}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1182, "end": 1192}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1215, "end": 1221}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1229}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1267}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 381}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1291, "end": 1295}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1400, "end": 1410}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 497, "end": 503}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 717, "end": 721}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 801}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 812, "end": 816}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 4}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 14}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 551}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 72}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 82}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 644, "end": 648}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 658}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 280}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 469}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1053}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 127}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1381, "end": 1395}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T32", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T34", "obj": "T21"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "PROTEIN", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "CPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
