Genetic linkage studies are presented for nine kindreds with Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD). This condition is an autosomal dominant macular dystrophy with reduced penetrance and highly variable expressivity. Asymptomatic carriers were identified with electro-oculography, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. Blood and saliva specimens were obtained from informative family members and genotyped for 26 polymorphic genetic traits. No firm evidence was found for linkage between BVMD and 18 informative markers; the highest positive lod score was z = 0.57 for GPT1 at a recombination fraction of theta = 0.30. An atypical form of vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD-1) is linked to GPT1 (theta less than 0.05) and is provisionally assigned to chromosome 16pter-p11. Our data are not sufficient to rule out loose linkage for GPT1 and BVMD. Thus we were not able to determine whether BVMD and VMD-1 are allelic mutations or separate genetic disorders. Additional linkage and gene mapping studies of these loci and BVMD (as well as other atypical forms of macular dystrophy) would be useful to further delineate these disorders.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 43}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 142}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 740, "end": 746}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 750, "end": 754}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 954}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 959, "end": 964}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 977, "end": 986}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1121, "end": 1138}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 144, "end": 148}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 221}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 232}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 265}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 548, "end": 552}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 629, "end": 633}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 699, "end": 728}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 735}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T14"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
