This study investigated the differences in airway mechanics and postoperative respiratory complications using two mechanical ventilation modalities and the relationship between biomarkers and postoperative respiratory complications in patients with colorectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic colectomy. Forty-six patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for laparoscopic colectomy were randomly allocated to receive mechanical ventilation using either volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) (n = 23) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (n = 23). Respiratory parameters were measured and plasma sRAGE and S100A12 were collected 20 minutes after the induction of anesthesia in the supine position without pneumoperitoneum (T1), 40 minutes after 30  Trendelenburg position with pneumoperitoneum (T2), at skin closure in the supine position (T3), and 24 hours after the operation (T4). The peak airway pressure (Ppeak) at T2 was lower in the PCV group than in the VCV group. The plateau airway pressures (Pplat) at T2 and T3 were higher in the VCV group than in the PCV group. Plasma levels of sRAGE at T2 and T3 were 1.6- and 1.4-fold higher in the VCV group than in the PCV group, while plasma S100A12 levels were 2.6- and 2.2-fold higher in the VCV group than in the PCV group, respectively. There were significant correlations between Ppeak and sRAGE, and between Ppeak and S100A12. There were also correlations between Pplat and sRAGE, and between Pplat and S100A12. sRAGE and S100A12 levels at T2 and T3 showed high sensitivity and specificity for postoperative respiratory complications. Postoperative respiratory complications were 3-fold higher in the VCV group than in the PCV group. In conclusion, during laparoscopic colectomy in patients with colorectal cancer, the peak airway pressure, the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications, and plasma sRAGE and S100A12 levels were lower in the PCV group than in the VCV group. Intra- and postoperative plasma sRAGE and S100A12 were useful for predicting the development of postoperative respiratory complications.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 122}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1059}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1155, "end": 1161}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1209, "end": 1215}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1219, "end": 1224}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1261, "end": 1267}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 163}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1321, "end": 1328}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1329, "end": 1335}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1359, "end": 1365}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1474, "end": 1479}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1503, "end": 1510}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 227}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1559, "end": 1564}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1588, "end": 1595}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1597, "end": 1602}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1607, "end": 1614}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1693, "end": 1718}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 1734, "end": 1759}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 1772, "end": 1778}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 1786, "end": 1789}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 355}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 1881, "end": 1898}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 1904, "end": 1924}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T42", "span": {"begin": 1957, "end": 1982}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T43", "span": {"begin": 1995, "end": 2000}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T44", "span": {"begin": 2005, "end": 2012}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T45", "span": {"begin": 2025, "end": 2030}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T47", "span": {"begin": 2103, "end": 2108}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T48", "span": {"begin": 2113, "end": 2120}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T49", "span": {"begin": 2152, "end": 2163}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 390}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T50", "span": {"begin": 2181, "end": 2206}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 453, "end": 470}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 723, "end": 728}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 733, "end": 740}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1015, "end": 1035}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T51", "span": {"begin": 1443, "end": 1455}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T52", "span": {"begin": 1528, "end": 1540}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T53", "span": {"begin": 1615, "end": 1621}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R25", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T42", "obj": "T45"}, {"id": "R26", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T43", "obj": "T45"}, {"id": "R27", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T50", "obj": "T49"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R28", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T18"}, {"id": "R30", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R32", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T53"}, {"id": "R33", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T34", "obj": "T53"}, {"id": "R34", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T44", "obj": "T45"}, {"id": "R35", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T41", "obj": "T45"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd", "default": true}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "VAR"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
