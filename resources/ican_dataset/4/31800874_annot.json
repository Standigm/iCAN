OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of systemic and topical ozone application on alveolar bone loss (ABL) by evaluating the effect of Hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha (HIF-1-alpha) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)-positive cells on histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in a rat periodontitis model. METHODOLOGY: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: 1) Group C (control group); 2) Group SO (systemic ozone group) and 3) Group TO (topical ozone group). Experimental periodontitis was induced with a 3/0 silk suture placed at the mandibular left first molars of rats, and the suture was removed 14 days later. Ozone gas was injected intraperitoneally (0.7 mg/kg) in SO group. Topical ozone application protocol was performed using an ozone generator at 80% concentration (4th grade) 90- degree probe for the duration of 30 s. Both ozone applications were carried out for two weeks at intervals of two days. Histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. RESULTS: ABL was significantly lower in Group SO compared to Group C (p: 0.0052). HIF-1alpha- positive cells were significantly lower in Group TO than in Group C (p: 0.0043). RANKL-positive cells were significantly lower in Group SO and in Group TO compared to the control group (p: 0.0033, p: 0.0075, respectively). CONCLUSION: Both ozone applications decreased RANKL-positive cell counts, TO application decreased HIF-1-alpha positive cells counts, and SO application was found to be more effective in reducing ABL compared to control group.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 83}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 318, "end": 329}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 248}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 660, "end": 673}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 1249, "end": 1260}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 678, "end": 685}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 1342, "end": 1362}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-15", "span": {"begin": 1295, "end": 1300}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-16", "span": {"begin": 1382, "end": 1387}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-17", "span": {"begin": 1261, "end": 1275}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-18", "span": {"begin": 1198, "end": 1203}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-19", "span": {"begin": 1176, "end": 1179}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 468}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-20", "span": {"begin": 1530, "end": 1556}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-21", "span": {"begin": 1501, "end": 1519}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-22", "span": {"begin": 1520, "end": 1529}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-23", "span": {"begin": 1583, "end": 1594}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-24", "span": {"begin": 1595, "end": 1616}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-25", "span": {"begin": 1573, "end": 1582}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-26", "span": {"begin": 1653, "end": 1667}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T-27", "span": {"begin": 1680, "end": 1683}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-28", "span": {"begin": 1671, "end": 1679}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 279}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 418, "end": 445}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 369}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 253}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 413}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 283, "end": 316}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 376}, "obj": "GENE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-2", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-2", "obj": "T-8"}, {"id": "R-10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-19", "obj": "T-18"}, {"id": "R-11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-22"}, {"id": "R-12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-21", "obj": "T-22"}, {"id": "R-13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-23", "obj": "T-25"}, {"id": "R-14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-23", "obj": "T-24"}, {"id": "R-15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-24", "obj": "T-25"}, {"id": "R-16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-27", "obj": "T-26"}, {"id": "R-17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-27", "obj": "T-28"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-2", "obj": "T-4"}, {"id": "R-3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-10", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R-4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-6", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R-5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-9", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R-6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-5", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R-7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-11", "obj": "T-13"}, {"id": "R-9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-14", "obj": "T-16"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-1", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T-3"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "CPA", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "POSREG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
