AIMS: This pilot study assessed the efficacy, safety, and microbiome dynamics of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for patients with chronic pouchitis. METHODS: A prospective open-label pilot study was performed at an academic center among pouchitis patients undergoing FMT. Patients received a minimum of a single FMT by pouchoscopy from healthy, screened donors. The primary outcome was clinical improvement in pouchitis assessed by patient survey at week 4. Secondary outcomes included decrease in total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) Score &gt;= 3 at week 4, bowel movement frequency, ESR, CRP, fecal calprotectin, abdominal pain, and PDAI subscores including endoscopic and histologic changes. Stool samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks post-FMT to assess bacterial microbiota using V4 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled; however, 1 patient was lost to follow-up. No patients had a major adverse event or escalation of therapy related to FMT. Total PDAI scores, endoscopic scores, and histologic scores did not decrease significantly post-FMT. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in bowel movement (BM) frequency (9.25-7.25 BM/day, p = 0.03) and trend for improvement in abdominal pain to improve post-FMT (p = 0.05). Bacterial microbiota profiling revealed no distinct community-level changes post-FMT, though a small number of specific bacterial taxa significantly differed in relative abundance. CONCLUSIONS: A single FMT has a tolerable short-term safety profile and may be associated with a decrease in bowel movements in patients with chronic pouchitis; however, no robust endoscopic or histologic changes were observed.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 45}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 279}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 1142, "end": 1159}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1182}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1191, "end": 1199}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1271, "end": 1282}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1315}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1359, "end": 1370}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1374, "end": 1388}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1392, "end": 1399}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1489, "end": 1496}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1681, "end": 1691}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 378}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1699, "end": 1707}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1744, "end": 1761}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1796, "end": 1814}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 542, "end": 551}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 626}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 662}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 735}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 743, "end": 755}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 771}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1129, "end": 1140}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 701, "end": 725}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1711, "end": 1726}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T20"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "REG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
