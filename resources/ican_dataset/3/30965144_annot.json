We describe herein an extremely severe case of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 7 (AGS7). The female patient was the daughter of nonconsanguineous parents and developed cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion, splenomegaly, and intracranial calcification during the fetal period. Because her cardiotocogram showed a non-reassuring fetal status, she was delivered at 29 weeks and 4 days of gestation by an emergency cesarean section. After birth, she suffered from respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, refractory fever, recurrent thrombocytopenia, and abdominal distention caused by hepatomegaly and ascites. She showed a lenticulostriate vasculopathy, which was compatible with the fetal intracranial calcification. Despite various intensive care procedures, she died of gradually progressive pulmonary hypertension at 3 months of age. After her death, whole exome sequencing on the patient and the parents was performed and revealed a novel, de novo, heterozygous mutation in the IFIH1 gene (IFIH1:NM_022168:exon12:c.2439A &gt; T:p.Glu813Asp). On the basis of the mutation and the clinical features, the diagnosis was AGS7. Although AGS7 has been regarded as a relatively mild subtype of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, this case indicates that the c.2439A &gt; T variant of AGS7 can be fatal in early infancy.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 56}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 70, "end": 77}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 585}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 704}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 736}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 774, "end": 800}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 901}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 86}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1011, "end": 1019}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1051, "end": 1059}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1067, "end": 1072}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1205, "end": 1209}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1220, "end": 1224}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1332, "end": 1339}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1345, "end": 1354}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1358, "end": 1362}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1370, "end": 1375}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 331}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1128}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1102, "end": 1109}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 163}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 169}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 250}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 527, "end": 535}, "obj": "REG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R20", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R21", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T29", "obj": "T27"}, {"id": "R22", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T29", "obj": "T28"}, {"id": "R23", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R24", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T32", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R25", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T1"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
