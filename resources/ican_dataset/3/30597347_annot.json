Although several reports suggest that the entry of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) depends on lipid rafts and low pH, the endocytic route and intracellular trafficking are unclear. In this study, we aimed to shed greater light on early steps in IBV infection. By using chemical inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant negative mutants, we observed that lipid rafts and low pH was indeed required for virus entry; IBV mainly utilized the clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) for entry; GTPase dynamin 1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission; and the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. By using R18 labeled virus, we found that virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. Finally, by using dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion was induced after 1 h.p.i. in late endosome/lysosome.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 924}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 939, "end": 948}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 962}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1041}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1053}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 643, "end": 651}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 828, "end": 833}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 895, "end": 907}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 915}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 81}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 393}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 604}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 606, "end": 609}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 638}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 742, "end": 768}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T20"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "CPA", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "VAR"}], "relation types": [{"id": "CauseOf"}, {"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
