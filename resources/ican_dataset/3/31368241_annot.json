Recently a recessive mutation in POLR1C causative of Pol III-related leukodystrophies was identified.\nMETHODS: We report the case of a Tunisian girl of 14\u00a0years of age who was referred to our department for evaluation of progressive ataxia that began at the age of 5. Genetic diagnosis was performed by NGS and Sanger analysis. In silico predictions were performed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and Mutation Taster.\nRESULTS: Neurological examination showed cerebellar and tetrapyramidal syndrome, mixed movement disorders with generalized dystonia and severe myoclonus leading to death at 25\u00a0years. Brain MRI scans showed diffuse hypomyelination associated with cerebellar atrophy. It also showed bilateral T2 hypointensity of the ventrolateral thalamus, part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Next generation sequencing leukodystrophy panel including POLR3A and POLR3B was negative. Sanger sequencing of the coding regions of POLR1C revealed a novel homozygous mutation.\nCONCLUSION: The clinical and imaging findings of patients with POLR1C hypomyelinating leukodystrophy are reviewed. Interestingly, severe myoclonic dystonia and T2 hypointensity of the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus are not reported yet and could be helpful for the diagnosis of POLR1C hypomyelinating leukodystrophy.", "project": "sonoma", "denotations": [{"id": "T-0", "span": {"begin": 6, "end": 12}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-1", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 21}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-10", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 726}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-11", "span": {"begin": 885, "end": 891}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-12", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 915}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-13", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 966}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-14", "span": {"begin": 977, "end": 993}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T-15", "span": {"begin": 1185, "end": 1191}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-16", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1202}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-17", "span": {"begin": 1260, "end": 1266}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-18", "span": {"begin": 1284, "end": 1303}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-19", "span": {"begin": 1368, "end": 1374}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-2", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 66}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-20", "span": {"begin": 1391, "end": 1405}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-21", "span": {"begin": 1465, "end": 1481}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T-22", "span": {"begin": 1597, "end": 1603}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-23", "span": {"begin": 1620, "end": 1634}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T-3", "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 240}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T-4", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 253}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-5", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 263}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-6", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 274}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-7", "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 305}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T-8", "span": {"begin": 309, "end": 315}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T-9", "span": {"begin": 316, "end": 325}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 170}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R-0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-0", "obj": "T-1"}, {"id": "R-1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-6", "obj": "T-4"}, {"id": "R-10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-12", "obj": "T-11"}, {"id": "R-2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-7", "obj": "T-9"}, {"id": "R-3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-8", "obj": "T-7"}, {"id": "R-4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-14", "obj": "T-13"}, {"id": "R-5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-17", "obj": "T-18"}, {"id": "R-6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-4", "obj": "T-3"}, {"id": "R-7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-5", "obj": "T-4"}, {"id": "R-8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-2", "obj": "T-1"}, {"id": "R-9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T-20", "obj": "T-19"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T-3"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE", "default": true}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
