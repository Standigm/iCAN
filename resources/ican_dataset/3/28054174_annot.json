{"sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "28054174", "text": "Genome-wide meta-analyses of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts identify novel associations between FOXE1 and all orofacial clefts, and TP63 and cleft lip with or without cleft palate.\nNonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are a heterogeneous group of common craniofacial birth defects with complex etiologies that include genetic and environmental risk factors. OFCs are commonly categorized as cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate alone (CP), which have historically been analyzed as distinct entities. Genes for both CL/P and CP have been identified via multiple genome-wide linkage and association studies (GWAS); however, altogether, known variants account for a minority of the estimated heritability in risk to these craniofacial birth defects. We performed genome-wide meta-analyses of CL/P, CP, and all OFCs across two large, multiethnic studies. We then performed population-specific meta-analyses in sub-samples of Asian and European ancestry. In addition to observing associations with known variants, we identified a novel genome-wide significant association between SNPs located in an intronic TP63 enhancer and CL/P (p\u00a0=\u00a01.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)). Several novel loci with compelling candidate genes approached genome-wide significance on 4q21.1 (SHROOM3), 12q13.13 (KRT18), and 8p21 (NRG1). In the analysis of all OFCs combined, SNPs near FOXE1 reached genome-wide significance (p\u00a0=\u00a01.33\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-9)). Our results support the highly heterogeneous nature of OFCs and illustrate the utility of meta-analysis for discovering new genetic risk factors.", "project": "sonoma", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 29, "end": 58}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 86}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 428}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 434}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 440, "end": 445}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 462}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 544}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 549, "end": 551}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 673}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 814, "end": 818}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 820, "end": 822}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1000, "end": 1012}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 100}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1032}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1091}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1132}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1146, "end": 1150}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1290, "end": 1295}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1308, "end": 1312}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 125}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 135}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 209}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 361}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 390, "end": 399}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 178}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1270, "end": 1277}, "obj": "GENE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T3", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T26", "obj": "T1"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
