Study of urinary homogentisic acid and a determinantion of group HLA were carried out for 36 members of a family spread over three generations with three cases of ochronotic rheumatism in the second generation. Alkaptonuria was discovered in seven other subjects, six of them members of the third generation: urinary elimination was poor, less than 0.60 g/24 hours. There is a certain degree of consanguinity in the family studied here and these findings do not therefore rule out a recessive autosomal transmission of the alkaptonuria. They do however lead to the consideration that alkaptonuria may sometimes be found in heterozygotic subjects. A genetic relationship between HLA complex and alkaptonuria can only be claimed with difficulty from this familial study, but the high frequency of B 27 antigen (29 out of 36 members carring it) leaves room for the hypothesis that the B 27 gene, or more precisely a gene associated with the B 27 gene, plays a part in the development of ochronotic rheumatism.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 1, "end": 8}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 33}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 571}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 620, "end": 632}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 655}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 742}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 831, "end": 843}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 918, "end": 922}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 70}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1016}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1020, "end": 1041}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 220}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 259}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 264, "end": 274}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 353, "end": 364}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 373}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 539, "end": 551}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 978}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 985, "end": 997}, "obj": "REG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T23"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T23"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
