INTRODUCTION: Since March 2011, the microbial collagenase of Clostridium histolyticum (Xiapex , Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden) has become available in the European Union for treatment of Dupuytren's disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential safety risks of Xiapex  and to contribute to a better understanding for its use. METHODS: A prospective, non-interventional, observational study using Xiapex  for Dupuytren's disease named XIANIS was conducted between 1.10.2011 and 01.10.2017. Treatment was conducted in accordance to the manufacturer information. Patients were invited for follow-up after 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. Demographic data, treatment data, pain levels, anaesthetic application during passive manipulation, subjective function improvement, subjective satisfaction and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: 788 patients with 814 treatments were included who suffered from Dupuytren's contracture for a mean of 64 months. The metacarpophalangeal joint was affected in 57% of cases and the PIP joint in 40.8% with a mean contracture of 39  and 56 , respectively. A change in the contracture down to 0 -5  was reported in 66.5% of cases, while 25.5% achieved a partial improvement. The pain during the injection was rated 4.5 and 3.3 during passive manipulation. Adverse events were reported in the majority of treated patients with skin tears being one main common event (26%). Further adverse outcomes were bleeding/hematoma, joint swelling, injection-site swelling, pressure sensitivity, erythema, injection-site pain, peripheral edema, blood blisters, blisters, painless lymphadenopathy, painful lymphadenopathy, axillary pain, arthralgia and sensory abnormality. There were no reported tendon ruptures, anaphylactic reactions or ligament injuries. On 1-year follow-up, 29% showed an increased contracture of a mean of 24  with the need for surgical treatment in 2% of patients. 74% of patients were very satisfied and 72% showed a high functional improvement. CONCLUSION: The injectable collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiapex ) proved to be effective and safe in patients with Dupuytren's disease. Minor adverse events disappeared within 30 days and the need for surgical treatment within 1 year was very low (2%). No major complications or rare side effects were seen in this prospective observational study.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 104}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 1299, "end": 1303}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1317, "end": 1325}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1376, "end": 1387}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1985, "end": 1991}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1995, "end": 2004}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 349, "end": 368}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 2005, "end": 2016}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 2295, "end": 2314}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 63}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 202}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 2199, "end": 2210}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 2259, "end": 2268}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 1616, "end": 1633}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 1635, "end": 1649}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T42", "span": {"begin": 1651, "end": 1674}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T43", "span": {"begin": 1698, "end": 1706}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T44", "span": {"begin": 1729, "end": 1745}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T45", "span": {"begin": 1773, "end": 1797}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T46", "span": {"begin": 1799, "end": 1822}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T47", "span": {"begin": 1898, "end": 1913}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T48", "span": {"begin": 1915, "end": 1937}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 604}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 1068, "end": 1076}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 1082, "end": 1105}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 1165, "end": 1173}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1273, "end": 1279}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T49", "span": {"begin": 1824, "end": 1837}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T50", "span": {"begin": 1839, "end": 1849}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T51", "span": {"begin": 1854, "end": 1873}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T29", "obj": "T28"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T30", "obj": "T28"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T30", "obj": "T29"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T34", "obj": "T39"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "CPA", "default": true}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
