BACKGROUND: Destombes-Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare multisystemic histiocytosis. Pulmonary involvement during RDD is poorly described. Here, we aimed to examine the clinical features, radiological features, and outcomes of 15 patients with RDD with lung involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cases of RDD with lung involvement were extracted from the French National Histiocytosis registry. Efficacy of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib in treating lung disease was evaluated with an 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission topography (18FDG PET) scanner and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (6 women; median age of 40 years at RDD diagnosis) were included. All patients had evidence of systemic disease with extra-pulmonary localizations of the disease (lymphadenopathy (n=12), skin (n=9), bones (n=6), retroperitoneal involvement (n=3), sinuses (n=3), parotid (n=2), sub mandibular gland (n=1) and breast (n=1)). Presenting symptoms were dominated by dyspnea and dry cough in 7 patients. Restrictive physiology was observed in 2 out of 5 patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated lymphocytosis in 1 out 5 cases. Eight patients received corticosteroids, all but one with variable immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Two patients received cobimetinib for severe lung disease with dramatic pulmonary metabolic and tumoral responses. Two patients died during follow-up: one due to hemoptysis and the other from an unrelated cerebral tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary involvement in RDD is rare, proteiform, and sometimes severe. The MEK inhibitor cobimetinib can lead to dramatic responses.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 51}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 801}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 940}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 111}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1187, "end": 1195}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1243, "end": 1255}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1663, "end": 1666}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1714, "end": 1717}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1744, "end": 1748}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1761, "end": 1770}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 448}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1256, "end": 1269}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 1476, "end": 1517}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 1718, "end": 1727}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 178}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 183}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 222}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 256}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 386}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 551, "end": 554}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 92, "end": 100}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 121}, "obj": "NEGREG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T35", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T30", "obj": "T37"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T37", "obj": "T32"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T32"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T39"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T38"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T39"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T38", "obj": "T39"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T2"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
