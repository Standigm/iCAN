Understanding and elucidating the mechanism of host-pathogen interactions are the major area of interest among the Parasitologists all around the globe. Starting from the origin on mother earth parasites have searched for successful strategies to invade their respective host for the sake of survivability and eventually succeeded to manage in the unfriendly environment inside the host's body. Parasite-generated antioxidants are potent enough to combat the oxidative challenges inside the host body and within its own as well. Antioxidant enzymes are tremendously important as they are directly related to the survival of the parasites. The thiol-based antioxidant enzymes (glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase) have dragged much attention of the researchers to date. In this regard, among the thiol-based antioxidants, particularly the Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), is known to be present in a number of parasitic organisms have pulled the researchers. Therefore, selective targeting of TrxR can emerge as a novel capital for developing suitable adulticidal candidate for treating filariasis and other helminth infections. This review tries to assemble the existing knowledge of the parasitic TrxR and how these can be utilized as a druggable target in cases of filariasis and other helminth infections has been discussed.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 89}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 113}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1017}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1019, "end": 1023}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1134, "end": 1143}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1147, "end": 1151}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1241, "end": 1251}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1422, "end": 1432}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 451}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 600}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 743, "end": 750}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 758, "end": 766}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 848, "end": 869}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 876, "end": 883}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 822, "end": 843}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1262, "end": 1281}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1353, "end": 1357}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1409}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 16, "end": 28}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T5"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T18"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE", "default": true}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
