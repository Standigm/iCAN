Report of compassionate use in a small cohort of patients. BACKGROUND: The symptomatic treatment of myotonia and myalgia in patients with dystrophic and non-dystrophic myotonias is often not satisfactory. Some patients anecdotally report symptoms' relief through consumption of cannabis. METHODS: A combination of cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol (CBD/THC) was prescribed as compassionate use to six patients (four patients with myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2, and 2 patients with CLCN1-myotonia) with therapy-resistant myotonia and myalgia. CBD/THC oil was administered on a low dose in the first 2 weeks and adjusted to a higher dose in the following 2 weeks. Myotonia behaviour scale (MBS), hand-opening time, visual analogue scales (VAS) for myalgia and myotonia, and fatigue and daytime sleepiness severity scale (FSS, ESS) were performed weekly to monitor treatment response. RESULTS: All patients reported an improvement of myotonia especially in weeks 3 and 4 of treatment: MBS improved of at least 2 points in all patients, the hand-opening time variously improved in 5 out of 6 patients. Chronic myalgia was reported by both DM2 patients at baseline, one of them experienced a significant improvement of myalgia under treatment. Some gastrointestinal complaints, as abdominal pain and diarrhoea, improved in 3 patients; however, 4 out of 6 patients reported new-onset constipation. No other relevant side effect was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: These first empirical results suggest a potentially beneficial role of CBD/THC in alleviating myotonia and should encourage further research in this field including a randomized-controlled trial on larger cohorts.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 11, "end": 23}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 52}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 162}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 167, "end": 174}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 231}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 308}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 332, "end": 340}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 404}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 406, "end": 413}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 536, "end": 540}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 555}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 526}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 541, "end": 555}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 580, "end": 588}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 600}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 609}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 964, "end": 972}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 976, "end": 987}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 991, "end": 999}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 730}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 806, "end": 813}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 818, "end": 826}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1046, "end": 1054}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1125, "end": 1133}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1097, "end": 1114}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1166, "end": 1173}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1178, "end": 1186}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1195, "end": 1198}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1274, "end": 1281}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1270}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1366, "end": 1374}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 1304, "end": 1331}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1355, "end": 1364}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1336, "end": 1350}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1419, "end": 1427}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1438, "end": 1450}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1586}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 1590, "end": 1601}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 1602, "end": 1610}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T23"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T29"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T31", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T31"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T32", "obj": "T31"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T35", "obj": "T34"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T36", "obj": "T37"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T38", "obj": "T37"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T11"}]}
