BACKGROUND: Low levels of serum CC16 were reported in asthmatic adults, but the studies on children were scarce and conflicting. The aim of this study was to compare serum CC16 levels in pre-school children with recurrent wheezing assessed using an asthma predictive index (API). METHODS: We performed a case-control study based on API, with all enrolled pre-school children who had recurrent wheezing episodes (&gt;3 episodes/last year confirmed by a physician) and had presented at one paediatric clinic in Santiago, Chile. The population was divided according to stringent API criteria into positive or negative. RESULTS: In a one-year period, 60 pre-schoolers were enrolled. After excluding 12, 48 pre-schoolers remained (27 males, age range from 24 to 71 months) and completed the study; 34 were API positive and 14 were API negative. There were no significant differences in demographics between groups. The level of serum CC16 levels for pre-schoolers with a positive API and negative API were (median 9.2 [7.1-11.5] and 9.4 [5.5-10], p=0.26, respectively). The area under the curve for the serum CC16 levels to predict a positive API was 0.6, 95% CI [0.43-0.77], p=0.3. A correlation between serum CC16 levels and age was found (r=0.36 [0.07-0.59], p=0.01], but not between serum CC16 levels and peripheral eosinophils blood. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that serum CC16 levels played a role in recurrent wheezing and a positive API in pre-school children. More studies are needed to confirm this finding.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 27}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1034, "end": 1038}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1071, "end": 1079}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1088, "end": 1096}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1209, "end": 1213}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1234, "end": 1246}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1311, "end": 1315}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1484, "end": 1488}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 120}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 127}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 141}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 45}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 281}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 360}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1393, "end": 1397}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T3", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T21"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
