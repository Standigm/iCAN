BACKGROUND: Paronychia is a common adverse event caused by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. However, high rates of post-treatment discomfort, infection, recurrence, and increased time to return to work have been noted after nail plate avulsion for EGFR inhibitor-induced paronychia. Furthermore, poor wound healing and malnutrition were common conditions found in cancer patients. The aim of this study is to find an effective, pain-relieving, and noninvasive treatment for patients with severe paronychia induced by EGFR inhibitors. METHODS: Data from a series of 35 non-small cell lung cancer cases suffering from EGFR inhibitor-induced paronychia with pyogenic granuloma-like lesions of digits treated with betaxolol 0.25% ophthalmic solution once daily were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients suffering from grade 2 or 3 paronychia with pyogenic granuloma-like lesions induced by EGFR inhibitors, 34 (97.1%) demonstrated complete resolution and only one (2.9%) had partial resolution after 12 weeks of topical betaxolol treatment. The grading of paronychia according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events decreased from an average of 2.29 to 0.63 after 4 weeks of treatment (P = 5.55 x 10-16 ). All the patients had significant improvement (50% pain reduction), as their pain visual analogue scale scores decreased from an average of 7.06 to 2.26 after one week of treatment (P = 6.11 x 10-25 ). CONCLUSION: Betaxolol 0.25% ophthalmic solution is an effective, safe, and pain-relieving treatment for patients suffering from EGFR inhibitor-induced paronychia with pyogenic granuloma-like lesions and deep fissures.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 443, "end": 447}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 476}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 690, "end": 700}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 701, "end": 708}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 712, "end": 716}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 763, "end": 789}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 796, "end": 805}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 198}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 815}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 834, "end": 844}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 881}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1018}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1037, "end": 1047}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1084}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1092}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1100}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 225, "end": 231}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1262, "end": 1272}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1346}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1460, "end": 1471}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1482, "end": 1491}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 1537, "end": 1546}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 1756, "end": 1760}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 1779, "end": 1789}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 273}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 1795, "end": 1826}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 1831, "end": 1844}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 296, "end": 300}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T42", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 45}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T43", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 267}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T44", "span": {"begin": 496, "end": 509}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T45", "span": {"begin": 514, "end": 526}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 118}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 81}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T46", "span": {"begin": 1477, "end": 1481}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T25", "obj": "T27"}, {"id": "R16", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T26", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T26", "obj": "T27"}, {"id": "R20", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T32", "obj": "T33"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T16"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R21", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T23"}, {"id": "R22", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T39", "obj": "T40"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "MPA", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "CPA", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
