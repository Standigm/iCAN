Pachyonychia congenital (PC) is a rare genetic disorder of cornification and is classified into five types on the basis of keratin gene involved. There are no established treatment options available for PC. Sirolimus in both topical and oral form has been studied in management of PC. We report a young female with a novel genetic mutation in KRT6A gene who presented with painful palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and onychogryphosis, which was cosmetically disfiguring. She was prescribed oral sirolimus after all investigations. There was significant improvement in pain within a week. Pain relief was sustained at 1 year follow-up with topical treatment only. Serial nail avulsion surgeries were also done with showed significant cosmetic improvement in the nails. Medical therapies can be combined with surgery for a better cosmetic outcome and improvement in patient quality of life.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 22}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 33}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 524}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 644, "end": 655}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 833, "end": 844}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 919, "end": 935}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 119}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 123}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 299, "end": 301}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 379}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 427, "end": 435}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 444}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 463}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 504}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T3", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T3", "obj": "T7"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
