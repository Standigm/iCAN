The nuclear receptor Nurr1 (NR4A2) has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In contrast to most other nuclear receptors, the X-ray crystal structure of the Nurr1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) lacks any ligand-binding pocket (LBP). However, NMR spectroscopy measurements have revealed that the known Nurr1 agonist docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) binds to a region within the LBD that corresponds to the classical NR ligand-binding pocket (LBP). In order to investigate the structural dynamics of the Nurr1 LBD and to study potential LBP formation, the conformational space of the receptor was sampled using a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Docking of DHA into 50,000 LBD structures extracted from the simulation revealed the existence of a transient LBP that is capable to fully harbor the compound. The location of the identified pocket overlaps with the ligand-binding site suggested by NMR experiments. Structural analysis of the protein-ligand complex showed that only modest structural rearrangements within the Nurr1 LBD are required for LBP formation. These findings may support structure-based drug discovery campaigns for the development of receptor-specific agonists.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 65}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 127}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 795}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 914, "end": 939}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1132, "end": 1146}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1158, "end": 1163}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1185, "end": 1198}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 134}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 218}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 300, "end": 305}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 446}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 470}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 480}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 482, "end": 487}, "obj": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 641}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 177}, "obj": "REG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T3", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T3"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE", "default": true}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "INTERACTION"}, {"id": "REG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
