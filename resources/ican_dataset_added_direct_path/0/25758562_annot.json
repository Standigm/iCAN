INTRODUCTION: Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE type I) or dysfunction (C1-INH-HAE type II) is a rare disease characterized by recurrent episodes of edema with an estimated frequency of 1:50,000 in the global population without racial or gender differences. In this study we present the results of a nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE patients referring to 17 Italian centers, the Italian network for C1-INH-HAE, ITACA. METHODS: Italian patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study. Diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE was based on family and/or personal history of recurrent angioedema without urticaria and on antigenic and/or functional C1-INH deficiency. RESULTS: 983 patients (53% female) from 376 unrelated families were included in this survey. Since 1973, 63 (6%) patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE died and data from 3 patients were missing when analysis was performed. Accordingly, the minimum prevalence of HAE in Italy in 2013 is 920:59,394,000 inhabitants, equivalent to 1:64,935. Compared to the general population, patients are less represented in the early and late decades of life: men start reducing after the 5(th) decade and women after the 6(th). Median age of patients is 45 (IQ 28-57), median age at diagnosis is 26 years (IQ 13-41). C1-INH-HAE type 1 are 87%, with median age at diagnosis of 25 (13-40); type 2 are 13% with median age at diagnosis of 31 (IQ 16-49). Functional C1INH is &lt;=50% in 99% of patients. Antigen C1INH is &lt;=50% in 99% of type 1. C4 is &lt;=50% in 96% of patients. The chance of having C1-INH-HAE with C4 plasma levels &gt;50% is &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSION: This nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE provides for Italy a prevalence of 1:64,935. C1-INH-HAE patients listed in our database have a shorter life expectancy than the general population. An increased awareness of the disease is needed to reduce this discrepancy. Measurement of C4 antigen can exclude diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE with an accuracy &gt; 95%. This parameter should be therefore considered for initial screening in differential diagnosis of angioedema.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 75}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 44}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 207}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 271}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 438, "end": 448}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 515, "end": 525}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 560, "end": 569}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 575, "end": 585}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 655}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 723}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 741}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 776}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 51}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 777, "end": 783}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 784, "end": 794}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 943}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1055, "end": 1058}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1041, "end": 1051}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1394, "end": 1411}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1527, "end": 1537}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1538, "end": 1543}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1620, "end": 1622}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1676, "end": 1686}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 64}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1692, "end": 1694}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 1695, "end": 1708}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1769, "end": 1779}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1825, "end": 1835}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1875, "end": 1882}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1883, "end": 1898}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 2004, "end": 2015}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 2019, "end": 2029}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 2042, "end": 2051}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 2055, "end": 2065}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 122, "end": 128}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 2034, "end": 2041}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 2190, "end": 2200}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 187}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 141}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 152}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 121}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 171}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T35", "obj": "T33"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T35", "obj": "T34"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T5"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T26"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T4"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T38", "obj": "T40"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T38", "obj": "T39"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T37", "obj": "T40"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T37", "obj": "T39"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T8"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "CPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "CauseOf"}, {"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
