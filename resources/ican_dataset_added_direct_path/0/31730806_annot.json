BACKGROUND: Little is known in the difference of host factors between intestinal and gastric anisakiasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associated factors of intestinal anisakiasis in patient's characteristics and the subsequent variation compared to gastric anisakiasis. METHODS: At St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, a retrospective cohort study was conducted from April 2004 to June 2017. All adult patients who were clinically diagnosed as anisakiasis based on Computed Tomography (CT) scan or endoscopy were included, and anti-Anisakis antibodies (IgG and IgA) were measured for serological validation of anisakiasis, strengthen the diagnosis. Anisakiasis was categorized as either intestinal or gastric depending on its affected site. We compared patients' demographics, social history, and physical and laboratory findings between those with intestinal and gastric anisakiasis by bivariate analyses, followed by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included in this study, where the mean age (SD) was 46.5 (14.4) and 66.6% were male. Ninety-two patients (30.5%) had intestinal anisakiasis. Multivariate regression revealed that patients with intestinal anisakiasis were more 45 years old or older (odds ratio (OR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53-7.69), male (OR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.20-6.25) and regular alcohol drinker. In terms of the physical and laboratory findings, patients with intestinal anisakiasis had greater heart rate (OR 2.86, 95% CI: 1.33-6.25), higher total protein (OR 2.86, 95% CI: 1.16-6.67), and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 11.1, 95% CI: 3.03-33.3). CONCLUSIONS: Older males who were regular alcohol drinkers were associated with intestinal anisakiasis, and often heart rate, total protein, and CRP were elevated compared to those of patients with gastric anisakiasis.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 75}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 181}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 757, "end": 768}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 972, "end": 991}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1205, "end": 1227}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1281, "end": 1303}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1528, "end": 1550}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1555, "end": 1562}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1563, "end": 1573}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1604, "end": 1610}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1611, "end": 1624}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1659, "end": 1665}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 228, "end": 238}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1666, "end": 1684}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1785, "end": 1795}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1801, "end": 1823}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1847, "end": 1860}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1866, "end": 1869}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1875, "end": 1883}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1919, "end": 1938}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 250, "end": 272}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 343, "end": 362}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 563}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 729}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1686, "end": 1689}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 635, "end": 673}, "obj": "MPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T3", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T16", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T17"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T20", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T24", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T21", "obj": "T25"}, {"id": "R13", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T22", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T27"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
