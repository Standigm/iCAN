SATB2-associated syndrome is one example of a syndromic cleft palate that is accompanied by intellectual disability, and various dental anomalies. SATB2-associated syndrome can be caused by several different molecular mechanisms including intragenic mutations and deletions of SATB2. Here, we report two patients with SATB2 truncating mutations (p.Arg239* and p.Asp702Thrfs*38) and one with a 4.4 megabase deletion including the SATB2 locus. All three patients had cleft palate and other dysmorphic features including macrodontia wide diastema. None of the three patients had acquired any meaningful words at the age of 5 years. In a review of the linguistic natural history of presently reported three patients and 30 previously reported patients, only two patients had attained verbal skills beyond speaking a few words. This degree of delayed speech contrasts with that observed in the prototypic form of syndromic cleft palate, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The recognition of SATB2-associated syndrome prior to palatoplasty would be important for plastic surgeons and the families of patients because precise diagnosis should provide predictive information regarding the future linguistic and intellectual abilities of the patients. Macrodontia with a wide diastema and cleft palate is a helpful and highly suggestive sign for the diagnosis of SATB2-associated syndrome.", "project": "sonoma", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 25}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 139, "end": 164}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 457, "end": 462}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 474, "end": 483}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 487, "end": 493}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 515}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 545, "end": 553}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 573}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 604, "end": 616}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 657, "end": 682}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1069}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1071, "end": 1096}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 207}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1142}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1374, "end": 1385}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1411, "end": 1423}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1485, "end": 1510}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 216, "end": 227}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 231, "end": 254}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 284}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 325}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 398}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 403, "end": 412}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 421}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 311}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T12", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T21"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T2", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T9"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "REG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "CauseOf"}, {"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
