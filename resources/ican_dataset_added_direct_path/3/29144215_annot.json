Human gnathostomiasis is an emerging food-borne parasitic disease caused by nematodes of the genus Gnathostoma. Currently, serological tests are commonly applied to support clinical diagnosis. In the present study, a simple and rapid filtration-based test, dot immune-gold filtration assay (DIGFA) was developed using a partially purified antigen of Gnathostoma third-stage larvae (L3). A total of 180 serum samples were tested to evaluate the diagnostic potential of DIGFA for gnathostomiasis. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 96.7% (29/30) and 100% (25/25), respectively. The cross-reactivity with sera from other helminthiasis patients ranged from 0 to 4%, with an average of 1.6% (2/125). DIGFA using a partially purified L3 antigen was not only simple and rapid, but also more accurate than standard assays for the diagnosis of human gnathostomiasis. DIGFA may represent a promising tool for application in laboratories or in the field, without requiring any instrumentation.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 135, "end": 150}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 158, "end": 173}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 957}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1006, "end": 1021}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 224}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 645}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 745, "end": 761}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 796}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 893, "end": 903}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T2"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T6"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T10"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T13"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
