AIMS: The BRIGHT study has previously reported similar glycaemic control and comparable incidence and rates of hypoglycaemia over 24 weeks with insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) versus insulin degludec 100 U/mL (IDeg-100). However, less anytime (24 h) confirmed (&lt;=3.9 or &lt;3.0 mmol/L) hypoglycaemia with Gla-300 versus IDeg-100 during the initial titration period was also shown. This secondary analysis aimed to further investigate glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia in BRIGHT, focussing on the titration period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BRIGHT was a multicentre, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm, parallel-group, 24-week study in insulin-naive patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes initiated on Gla-300 (N=466) or IDeg-100 (N=463). Predefined efficacy and safety outcomes were investigated during the initial 12-week titration period. In addition, patients' characteristics and clinical outcomes were assessed descriptively, stratified by confirmed (&lt;=3.9 mmol/L) hypoglycaemia incidence during the initial titration period. RESULTS: At week 12, HbA1c was comparable between Gla-300 (7.32 %) and IDeg-100 (7.23 %), with similar least squares (LS) mean reductions from baseline (-1.37 % and -1.39 %, respectively; LS mean difference of 0.02; 95% confidence interval: -0.08 to 0.12). Patients who experienced hypoglycaemia during the initial titration period had numerically greater HbA1c reductions by week 12 than patients who did not (-1.46 % vs -1.28 %), and higher incidence of anytime (24 h; 73.3% vs 35.7%) and nocturnal (00:00-06:00 h; 30.0% vs 11.9%) hypoglycaemia between weeks 13-24. CONCLUSIONS: Use of Gla-300 resulted in similar glycaemic control as IDeg-100 during the initial 12-week titration period of the BRIGHT study, when less anytime (24 h) hypoglycaemia with Gla-300 vs IDeg-100 has been reported. Experiencing hypoglycaemia shortly after initiating Gla-300 or IDeg-100 may be associated with hypoglycaemia incidence in the longer term, potentially impacting glycaemic management.
