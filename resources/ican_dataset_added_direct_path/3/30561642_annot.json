BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPs) have been reported with dolutegravir use. We hypothesized that increasing dolutegravir trough concentrations (Ctrough) and/or polymorphism in the SLC22A2 gene, encoding the organic cation transporter-2 (OCT2), which is involved in monoamine clearance in the CNS and is inhibited by dolutegravir, might be associated with NPs. METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort of HIV-positive patients treated with a dolutegravir-containing regimen underwent determination of allelic discrimination for SLC22A2 808 C   A polymorphism and dolutegravir Ctrough. The Symptom Checklist-90-R [investigating 10 psychiatric dimensions and reporting a general severity index (GSI)], a self-reported questionnaire and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were offered to investigate current NPs. The effects of dolutegravir Ctrough and the SLC22A2 gene variant on NPs were explored by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A cohort of 203 patients was analysed: 71.4% were male, with median age 51 years and 11 years of ART exposure. Median time on dolutegravir was 18 months. Dolutegravir was associated with different antiretroviral combinations (mainly lamivudine, 38.9%, and abacavir/lamivudine, 35.5%). SLC22A2 CA genotype was independently associated with an abnormal GSI [adjusted OR (aOR) 2.43; P = 0.072], anxiety (aOR 2.61; P = 0.044), hostility (aOR 3.76; P = 0.012) and with moderate to severe headache (aOR 5.55; P = 0.037), and dolutegravir Ctrough was associated with hostility (fourth versus first quartile aOR 6.70; P = 0.007) and psychoticism (fourth versus first quartile aOR 19.01; P = 0.008). Other NPs were not associated with SLC22A2 polymorphism or dolutegravir Ctrough. CONCLUSIONS: A variant of the OCT2-encoding gene, in addition to or in synergy with higher dolutegravir Ctrough, is associated with a set of NPs observed during dolutegravir therapy.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 8, "end": 16}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 295}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 369}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 392}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 420}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 447, "end": 457}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 628, "end": 635}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 646, "end": 658}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 969, "end": 976}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 982, "end": 989}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1229, "end": 1239}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1343, "end": 1350}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1381, "end": 1391}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 50}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 1768, "end": 1778}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 1784, "end": 1791}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 1792, "end": 1804}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 1845, "end": 1852}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 1914, "end": 1920}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T43", "span": {"begin": 1946, "end": 1956}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 96}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T45", "span": {"begin": 1351, "end": 1362}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T46", "span": {"begin": 315, "end": 343}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T47", "span": {"begin": 268, "end": 280}, "obj": "VAR"}, {"id": "T48", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 508}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 345, "end": 349}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T49", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 310}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T50", "span": {"begin": 1860, "end": 1864}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T1", "obj": "T3"}, {"id": "R14", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R15", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T15"}, {"id": "R17", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T19"}, {"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T24"}, {"id": "R22", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T26", "obj": "T28"}, {"id": "R28", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T38", "obj": "T39"}, {"id": "R29", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T39", "obj": "T37"}, {"id": "R32", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T47"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R33", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T49"}, {"id": "R34", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T46", "obj": "T49"}, {"id": "R35", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T11", "obj": "T49"}, {"id": "R36", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T46", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R37", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T12"}, {"id": "R38", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T50", "obj": "T40"}, {"id": "R39", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T40", "obj": "T43"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "VAR"}, {"id": "REG", "default": true}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}, {"id": "CauseOf"}]}}
