A 30-year-old woman presented with persistent fever and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels without skin rash. F-FDG PET/CT revealed FDG uptake in subcutaneous tissues in the forearm, buttocks, and lower limbs, whereas the trunk was unaffected. She was diagnosed with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma based on a PET/CT-guided subcutaneous tissue biopsy from the thigh. Although conventional cytotoxic agent-based chemotherapies failed to achieve disease remission, subsequent cyclosporine A treatment promptly resolved the fever and laboratory abnormalities. Remarkably, abnormal FDG uptake disappeared entirely on follow-up PET/CT, demonstrating its utility in the evaluations of responses to emerging cyclosporine A-based treatments in subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 151}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 208}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 785}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 797}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 933, "end": 979}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 265}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 243}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 671, "end": 685}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 86}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 898, "end": 912}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 449, "end": 495}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 623, "end": 629}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 649, "end": 658}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 705, "end": 713}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 723}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T8"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T11"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T5", "obj": "T13"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "MPA"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "GENE"}], "relation types": [{"id": "CauseOf"}, {"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
