High-frequency hearing loss and S-Ca, but not hormones related to bone structure and strength, or lifestyle factors, predicted incident fractures during 17 years of follow-up in women up to 97 years of age. INTRODUCTION: The fracture risk increases and inner ear function deteriorates with increasing age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hearing loss was of greater importance than bone-regulating hormones for the risk of fracture in elderly women. METHODS: In 1997, a random population sample of 63-82-year-old women, n = 552, underwent a physical examination, audiometry and blood sampling for analyses of serum albumin-adjusted calcium (S-Ca), parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH) vitamin D and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Data on medication, lifestyle, previous fractures, hearing, vision and dizziness were obtained using questionnaires. Data on subsequent fractures were retrieved, and censored at death, through December 2013. RESULTS: In 1997, 228 women (41%) reported a previous fracture, most commonly of the wrist (18%). During the following 17 years, 323 fractures occurred in 207 women (38%). Hip fractures were the most frequent, in 96 women (17%). In a Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and previous fractures, hearing loss, reflected by a high pure tone average >= 59 dB, almost doubled the risk of a subsequent fracture (hazard ratio (HR) 1.81, 95% CI 1.25; 2.61, p = 0.002). S-Ca (HR 1.21 (1.02; 1.44) p = 0.028) also predicted future fractures, whereas PTH, IGF-1, 25(OH) vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, smoking, degree of physical activity, impaired vision and dizziness did not. CONCLUSION: Hearing loss and higher S-Ca, but not bone-regulating hormones, medication or lifestyle factors predicted incident fractures, mainly caused by falling, during 17 years of follow-up in women up to 97 years of age.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 12}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 54}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 843, "end": 871}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 873, "end": 878}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1123, "end": 1131}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1232, "end": 1240}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1297}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1388, "end": 1400}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1457, "end": 1464}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1598, "end": 1607}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1639, "end": 1644}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1731, "end": 1739}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1751, "end": 1760}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 1782, "end": 1794}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1799, "end": 1805}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1878, "end": 1887}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 1915, "end": 1921}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 256}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 369, "end": 378}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 402, "end": 414}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 157}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 497}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T0", "obj": "T1"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T8", "obj": "T9"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "REG", "default": true}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}], "relation types": [{"id": "CauseOf", "default": true}]}}
