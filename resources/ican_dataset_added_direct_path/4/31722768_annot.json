We established a mastitis model using exogenous infection of the mammary gland of Chinese Holstein cows with Staphylococcus aureus and extracted total RNA from S. aureus-infected and healthy mammary quarters. Differential expression of genes due to mastitis was evaluated using Affymetrix technology and results revealed a total of 1230 differentially expressed mRNAs. A subset of affected genes was verified via Q-PCR and pathway analysis. In addition, Solexa high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze profiles of miRNA in infected and healthy quarters. These analyses revealed a total of 52 differentially expressed miRNAs. A subset of those results was verified via Q-PCR. Bioinformatics techniques were used to predict and analyze the correlations among differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA. Results revealed a total of 329 pairs of negatively associated miRNA/mRNA, with 31 upregulated pairs of mRNA and 298 downregulated pairs of mRNA. Differential expression of miR-15a and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-like 2 (IRAK2), were evaluated by western blot and luciferase reporter assays. We conclude that miR-15a and miR-15a target genes (IRAK2) constitute potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs for use as biomarkers to predict a mastitis response.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1006}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1007, "end": 1017}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1038, "end": 1049}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1072, "end": 1085}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1140, "end": 1187}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1189, "end": 1194}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1311, "end": 1316}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1402, "end": 1410}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1101, "end": 1124}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 124}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1378, "end": 1388}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 157, "end": 165}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 397}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 1128, "end": 1135}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1277, "end": 1284}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1309}, "obj": "GENE"}], "relations": [{"id": "R19", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T14", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R21", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T29"}, {"id": "R22", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R23", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R24", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T23", "obj": "T22"}, {"id": "R25", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T33", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R26", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T32", "obj": "T30"}, {"id": "R27", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T27", "obj": "T28"}, {"id": "R28", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T32"}, {"id": "R29", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T28", "obj": "T33"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "PROTEIN", "color": "#77dddd"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
