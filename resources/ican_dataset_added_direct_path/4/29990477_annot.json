Due to the unsatisfactory performance of parasitological diagnosis of human fascioliasis; the use of immunodiagnosis based on the detection of anti-Fasciola antibodies is traditionally used as a diagnostic alternative using total or purified parasite excretory-secretory products (ESPs). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein, one of the F. hepatica ESP components, possesses well-known roles in the detoxification of xenobiotic and endogenously derived toxins within the host bile environment. GST has shown to be a good target for vaccine or drug development against fascioliasis. The current study aimed to evaluate the potential of GST protein purified from a soluble crude extract of adult flukes as an antigen for serodiagnosis of chronic human fascioliasis by indirect ELISA. The study included a panel of 116 serum samples collected from individuals with confirmed fascioliasis, individuals carrying heterologous parasitic infections and healthy subjects. The parasitological examination was used as gold standard and a previously optimized ESP-ELISA was used to compare the performance of the GST-ELISA method. Results demonstrated that GST-ELISA is 94.3% sensitive, 80.2% specific and exhibits a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.555) and substantial agreement (k = 0.786) with the results obtained with the ESP-ELISA method. Moreover, because no sera from patients with early F. hepatica infection were available, GST-ELISA was then tested with sera from rabbits experimentally infected with F. hepatica metacercariae. The assay was able to detect anti-Fasciola antibodies as early as the 3rd week of infection (p &lt; 0.0001) with peaks at 4th and 10th week post-infection.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 89}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 874, "end": 886}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 996, "end": 1008}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1678, "end": 1684}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1685, "end": 1698}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1769, "end": 1774}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 197, "end": 209}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 439}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 523, "end": 537}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 621}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 704}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 762}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 843, "end": 856}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 57}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 119}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 434}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 645, "end": 651}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1228}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1269, "end": 1272}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1551, "end": 1554}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}], "relations": [{"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T9"}, {"id": "R2", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T15", "obj": "T14"}, {"id": "R3", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R4", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R5", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T18", "obj": "T0"}, {"id": "R6", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T0"}, {"id": "R7", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T19", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R8", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T20"}, {"id": "R9", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T4", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R10", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T6", "obj": "T7"}, {"id": "R11", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T17", "obj": "T18"}, {"id": "R12", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T7", "obj": "T19"}], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "CPA"}, {"id": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "PROTEIN", "default": true}, {"id": "MPA"}], "relation types": [{"id": "ThemeOf", "default": true}]}}
