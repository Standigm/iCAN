A cDNA of a processed gene of human DAD-1 (defender against apoptotic cell death) was cloned from the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. The genomic sequence of this novel processed gene, DAD-R, lacked introns and was flanked by 8 bp terminal repeats. RT-PCR showed that the transcript is expressed predominantly in testis, ovaries, pancreas, lung and skeletal muscle. DAD-R has several possible initiation codons, one of them producing an open reading frame comprising 75% of the DAD-1 gene. We determined the chromosomal localization of DAD-R as 12p11.2-12p12.1, an area linked to familial synpolydactyly and frequently amplified in a variety of cancers, including those of testis, ovaries, pancreas and lungs.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 35}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 37, "end": 41}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 67}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 128}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 167}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 279, "end": 284}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 380, "end": 389}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 465}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 577}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 674, "end": 697}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 746}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 670}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 635}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 713, "end": 722}, "obj": "POSREG"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T9", "obj": "T13"}, {"id": "R1", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T10", "obj": "T13"}]}
