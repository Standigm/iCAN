A Danish material of 58 pedigrees with nonsyndromic orofacial cleft, selected out of a comprehensive Danish material for suggestiveness of autosomal dominant inheritance, was studied for linkage with 42 non-DNA polymorphic marker systems. Both cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL(P)) and cleft lip alone (CP) were, for the purpose of linkage analysis, scored as if they were due to an autosomal dominant gene with complete penetrance. The highest lod score was with the blood clotting factor XIIIA (F13A): for males alone z = 3.40 at theta = 0.00, for females alone z = 0.30 at theta = 0.21, and for these together z = 3.66 at at theta = 0.00 for males and 0.26 for females. Since F13A is known to be located distally on chromosome 6, we tentatively assign a major locus for orofacial cleft to this region. Since both CL(P) and CP pedigrees contribute to the positive score, the question arises whether this locus carries two cleft alleles.", "project": "Pseudo-labled dataset", "denotations": [{"id": "T0", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 21}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 71}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 81}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 191}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 318}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 406}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 413}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 419, "end": 428}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 439}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 628}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 630, "end": 634}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 812, "end": 816}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 881, "end": 887}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 906, "end": 921}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 954}, "obj": "CPA"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 959, "end": 961}, "obj": "CPA"}], "relations": [{"id": "R0", "pred": "ThemeOf", "subj": "T13", "obj": "T12"}]}
