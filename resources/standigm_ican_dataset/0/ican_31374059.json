This study means to investigate a combination of noninvasive methods in diagnosis of minimal or mild endometriosis expecting to narrow down the range of laparoscopic exploration for female infertility.It is a retrospective case control study of totally 447 patients suspected unexplained infertility before surgery were eligible from May 2012 to February 2017. Of these, 299 patients were laparoscopy-proved minimal or mild endometriosis group, the remaining 148 patients served as control group (normal pelvis). Preoperative age, duration of infertility, type of infertility, body mass index, baseline follicle-stimulating hormone, anti-Mullerian hormone, serum CA125, clinical symptoms, findings on vagino-recto-abdominal examinations and pregnancy prognosis had been recorded. Every variable and their combinations were evaluated.Any single factor had limited diagnostic value. The cut-off value for CA125 was 19.25 IU/L. Parallel testing had a higher sensitivity at 81.3%. Serial tests of vagino-recto-abdominal examination combined with dysmenorrhea or positive CA125 got reasonable sensitivity (51.4% and 49%), remarkable high specificities (95.7% and100%) and Positive Predictive Value (96.4% and 100%). Multivariate logistic regression identified the following factors in decreasing order of importance: (1) vagino-recto-abdominal examinations, (2) CA125, (3) dysmenorrhea, their ORs being 16.148, 3.796, and 2.809, respectively. The spontaneous pregnancy rate (50.8%) in minimal or mild endometriosis was higher than control (35.6%, P = .043).A combination of noninvasive diagnostic methods had certain preoperative diagnostic value of minimal or mild endometriosis, which might benefit some patients from avoiding laparoscopic surgery.", "project": "Standigm_training", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 101}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 1038, "end": 1043}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 1083, "end": 1089}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 1177, "end": 1189}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1202, "end": 1207}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 1212, "end": 1222}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1267}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1492, "end": 1497}, "obj": "GENE"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1503, "end": 1515}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 249}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1649, "end": 1655}, "obj": "POSREG"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1796, "end": 1809}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 317, "end": 335}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 559, "end": 572}, "obj": "DISEASE"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 803}, "obj": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 832}, "obj": "REG"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 990, "end": 997}, "obj": "NEGREG"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1631, "end": 1644}, "obj": "DISEASE"}], "relations": [], "attributes": [], "modifications": [], "config": {"entity types": [{"id": "DISEASE", "default": true}, {"id": "GENE"}, {"id": "POSREG"}, {"id": "PROTEIN"}, {"id": "REG"}, {"id": "NEGREG"}]}}
